      <description>Summary In this project I scrape movie reviews for the top 100 movies between 2000 and 2021 from Rotten Tomatoes (with the addition of Interstellar (2014)). After scraping the reviews, I apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the reviews dataset before training a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to attempt to perform sentiment analysis on further reviews. The model accurately predicted positive.negative reviews with 89% accuracy after all was said and done.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Colton. I&amp;rsquo;m a person with many hobbies, some of which may not make sense to mix together. First and foremost, I love to learn. I received a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Physics from Penn State Behrend, a branch campus of Penn State, in 2019. Afterwards, I moved on to study applied mathematics at Bowling Green State University and graduated with a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in 2021. I keep my brain in check by taking random courses on Coursera (and sometimes finishing them), and doing analysis on datasets in my spare time.</description>
