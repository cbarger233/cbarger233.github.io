<p>Long gone are the days when families boasted about cancelling their cable subscriptions in favor of Netflix. In April 2013 a standard Netflix subscription only cost $7.99 (USD). Nowadays, a standard subscription will fetch $15.49.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the price hike throughout the years, which can be visualized through January 2022 <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/netflix-pricing">here</a>. Since 2013 there has been inflation, costs of funding numerous Netflix original series, and increasing competition for online streaming. Networks realized that cable was a dying business and started their own streaming services. Many notable services include Disney+, HBO Max, Paramount+, and Hulu. While there are many others, these are the ones that came to mind at the time of writing, so be it.</p>
<p>There are many alternative forms of video entertainment people on the internet are turning to as well. Some internet folks, including myself, have subscriptions to individual streamers on, say, Twitch. A basic Twitch subscription costs as little as $4.99/month. This is quite the bargain depending on how many hours that streamer is online, and how entertained you feel while watching. Paying isn&rsquo;t even necessary to watch streamers on Twitch if you feel like putting up with ads (Although ads on Twitch are getting quite annoying recently. What&rsquo;s up with that?). YouTube has gotten into streaming as of late, in addition to the static video content it&rsquo;s offered for many years.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the streaming platforms Netflix, Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, Apple TV+, HBO Max, Prime Video, and Paramount+. I collected ratings for the top 100 shows on each of these networks on Rotten Tomatoes. Based on which platform has the shows with the best reviews, by both critics and audiences alike, we will see if there are any clearly better &ldquo;bang for your buck&rdquo;-type streaming services out of these. Some data was not able to be collected due to a new season of a show not being out yet. Some of these streaming services don&rsquo;t yet have 100 shows on their platforms either.</p>
<p>The data can be found at my kaggle page <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/coltonbarger/rotten-tomatoes-reviews-for-online-streaming-shows">here</a> if you want to do a deep dive into it yourself.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off by ranking each streaming service by the average rating of all reviews on their platforms. There are a few problems with this method, which I&rsquo;ll go over in a minute, but it is a basic way to establish an initial hierarchy.</p>
<p>Grouping audience reviews and averaging them out results in the following table, with reviews ranging from 0.5-5.0 stars:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center"><strong>Service</strong></th>
<th style="text-align:center"><strong>Average Audience Rating</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Netflix</td>
<td style="text-align:center">3.78</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Peacock</td>
<td style="text-align:center">3.67</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Disney+</td>
<td style="text-align:center">3.65</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Hulu</td>
<td style="text-align:center">3.57</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Apple TV+</td>
<td style="text-align:center">3.42</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">HBO Max</td>
<td style="text-align:center">3.11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Prime Video</td>
<td style="text-align:center">3.03</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Paramount+</td>
<td style="text-align:center">2.91</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can note that Netflix is still the top dog, according to this naive way of ranking, anyway.</p>
<p>As I said before, there are many things wrong with this way of ranking the networks. First, some networks will simply have more reviews than others due to the nature of shows they offer. The most egregious example is HBO Max&rsquo;s <em>Game of Thrones</em>: a show beloved by all, until the final season. Due to the ending of <em>Game of Thrones</em> it&rsquo;s gathered an exorbitant amount of negative reviews, which is most likely why HBO Max is so low in the above table.</p>
<p>Likewise, a really good show will gather a ton of positive reviews, inflating the streaming service&rsquo;s average audience rating in the table above.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re at it, let&rsquo;s do the same with critic reviews. It should be noted that critics do not use a scale from 0.5-5.0 on Rotten Tomatoes. Rather, they have either a &lsquo;1&rsquo; for a positive sentiment, and a &lsquo;0&rsquo; for a negative sentiment.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing both critics and audience agree on thus far, it&rsquo;s that Paramount+ is the most worthy of poor reviews. Again, this is a very naive way of ranking services for multiple reasons. Critics also seem to be more in favor of shows offered on Prime Video.</p>
<h3 id="histograms-of-show-ratings-by-network">Histograms of Show Ratings by Network</h3>
<p>A better way to rank streaming services would be to aggregate reviews by both the individual shows and the services they live on. This will give us a good idea of the quality of shows for each service along with their distributions. In doing this for audience reviews we get the following visualization:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cbarger.com/images/streaming_services_audience_histograms.png" alt="" title="Histograms of show reviews by network."></p>
<p>Many of the networks follow a similar scheme for their ratings distributions. The histograms (with the exception of Disney+) skew left with a peak somewhere in the neighborhood of 4.0. A few of the services are newer than the rest. These services are Apple TV+, Paramount+, Disney+, and Peacock. Because of this, they don&rsquo;t have as many shows on their histograms. This could be why Disney+ doesn&rsquo;t have an obvious left skew, but we will be able to see in a few years. It doesn&rsquo;t look like there is any noticeable difference between the services, but we can back up this claim using statistics.</p>
<p>I performed an F-Test in Python using the <code>stats</code> module. My main reason for choosing an F-Test was to compare all of the streaming service reviews at once. With an alpha level of α = 0.05 my null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Null</strong>: There is no difference between the streaming service reviews</p>
<p><strong>Alternative</strong>: There is at least one streaming service with ratings that are different from the rest</p>
<p>When performing the F-Test, I ended up with a p-value of 0.78. For those of you unfamiliar with hypothesis testing, this simply means that we don&rsquo;t have enough evidence to conclude a significant difference between any of the streaming networks.</p>
<p>I do the same with critic reviews pictured below.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cbarger.com/images/streaming_services_critic_histograms.png" alt="" title="Histograms of show reviews by network."></p>
<p>The critic reviews are different in that all of the histograms have an obvious left skew. This could be due to the fact that critic reviews are forced to be binary on Rotten Tomatoes. In general, a positive review is one that is 3.0/5 stars or higher, and a negative review is less than 3.0/5. This will skew more of the critic reviews in the positive direction.</p>
<p>All of the critic reviews have the same tendencies: plenty of positively-rated shows with a left skew tapering off around 0.4. However, looking at the scales of the histograms, some of these seem to be quite different, especially Disney+ which has very few rated shows.</p>
<p>Performing the same F-Test I did on the audience revieiws, we can get a p-value of 0.0546. At an alpha level of α = 0.05 this isn&rsquo;t enough evidence to conclude that any of the streaming services have different reviews, but it strongly suggests that at least one of them has a tendency to be different (at least from the data we have).</p>
<p>If I were a gambling man, I would say that any one of Disney+, Apple TV+, Paramount+, or Peacock could be causing our p-value to be so low in this F-Test. These are all newer networks that don&rsquo;t have as many reviewed shows as the other four. In fact, grouping these four together and performing the same F-Test on them confirms this claim.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, the streaming services don&rsquo;t differ by much in terms of review quality, at least statistically. You are free to draw your own conclusions and methods of going about purchasing subscriptions. I won&rsquo;t judge you at all, unless you subscribe to all of them. Then I most definitely will judge your ability to cancel free trials.</p>
